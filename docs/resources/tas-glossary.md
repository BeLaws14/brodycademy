## COMET

COMET is a legacy system is for putting things up onto the actual container website (container.redhat.com) for pulling images. If we're releasing images, and we're using RHTAP's data we need to have COMET entries to map to.

## FBC Images

An FBC image is an immutable base container image. It's a foundational image often used in containerized environments to ensure consistency, security, and reliability in deployments. Once built, an FBC image does not change. Any updates or changes will require a new image.
