## runtime

A runtime is the environment in which a program executes. Think of it as a combination of resources and settings that a program needs to run. For example, when you play a video game, the console or computer provides the necessary environment for the game to work properly. Similarly, a runtime provides the necessary support for a program, including memory management, input/output operations, and other essential functions.
