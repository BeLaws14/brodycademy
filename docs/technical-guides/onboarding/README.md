## Overviews

:::warning
NOTE: This section needs review
:::

### Securesign repo branches

Branches: the midstream branch, e.g. midstream-v2.1.1 is analogous to main. While main is our collection of overlays and patches for release-next the midstream-v2.1.1 branch is our collection of overlays and patches for a specific release line, e.g. redhat-2.1.1 which may differ from the latest stuff on main.

| Our branch       | Purpose                           | Tracking upstream       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |-------------------------|
| main             | overlays/patches for release-next | <p><br/></p>            |
| release-next     | pulls in upstream changes         | HEAD                    |
| midstream-vx.y.z | overlays/patches for redhat-x.y.z | <p><br/></p>            |
| redhat-x.y.z     | pulls in upstream changes         | Specific release branch |



### Documentation

* [TAS Deployment Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_trusted_artifact_signer/2023-q4/html-single/deployment_guide/index) on the Customer Portal.
* To view documentation preview builds on the Customer Portal:

1. Open a web browser.
2. Go to the [Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com), and login using your Red Hat SSO account.
3. Go to [Pantheon](https://pantheon.cee.redhat.com), and click Login. By logging in again, this creates your user account (if one does not already exist) in the Customer Portal preview and stage environments.
4. On the Titles page, type Trusted in the filter dialog box.
5. Click the Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer product.
6. On the Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer page, click the globe icon for the chosen environment: Preview, Stage, or Prod, from the published titles (currently just the Deployment Guide).

* A quick [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1730j-DQbe9QTeQUv64fv4DnEFY9DY1ZJ/view?usp=drive_link) demonstration on how to access the Customer Portal preview environment to view the latest documentation builds.
* Downstream documentation [Git repository](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/software-supply-chain-documentation/doc-rhtas).
* Upstream document [Git repository](https://github.com/securesign/sigstore-ocp).


### Image Build Overview

RHTAS is made up of a lot of images created across our repos. All of which are built from dockerfiles using the Konflux System.

1. Advised Reading
   1. [Component Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R02GS2wPElVC3yzxhPqtJaKh-dX1wFvd31Pu3MBOCmo/edit#gid=2049575423) (RHTAS Image List)
   2. [Konflux Docs](https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/getting-started/get-started/)
   3. Access to Konflux
   4. #TODO Konflux Repo Onboarding Video
2. Build Overview
   1. Each of our repos has a distinct dockerfile for each image we are building. [TrillianLogserver example](https://github.com/securesign/trillian/blob/main/Dockerfile.logserver.rh)
   2. Once a Dockerfile is created and is building correctly we then would onboard it to Konflux.



## Setting up your environment

Let's add some docs here, or a link to docs for our teammates to be able to set up their environments easily.

## Other things to know

* We have a daily standup (only required for engineering)
* Weekly meetings: Program call, Jira triage

:::info[Note]
Always refer to the RHTAS Google Calendar for the most up-to-date information about team meetings
