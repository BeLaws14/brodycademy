# How to Learn a New Programming Language

Everyone learns differently, and over time you'll eventually learn how you best learn new things, including programming languages, but here are some tips:

1. Find a good cheat sheet for the language (check out the [resources](../../resources))
2. Open up the docs for library or framework or programming language you're using
3. Start a project, ideally recreating something you already use and are familiar with (a common one is recreating Twitter or similar)
4. Repeat with a different problem/challenge, doing it in a slightly different way

You may find you get overwhelmed with the amount of information you're given, but just remember that you can't possibly retain it all at once. The more you look at something, the more patterns you start to recognize, the more familiar it becomes and the more you make sense of it.

You will not learn a language overnight, it can take weeks, months, even years, depending on the language and how much time you spend learning it. There are SO many parts of programming languages I've been using everyday for over a decade, that I have never had to use (or even heard about!). So, don't worry too much. :)
