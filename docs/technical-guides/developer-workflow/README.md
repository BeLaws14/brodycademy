# Developer Workflow

Depending on the size of the team you're working in, you might have to work with a version control system (VCS). One of the most popular is called git and it was created by the same person who created Linux, Linus Torvalds.

## Day-to-Day

On a day-to-day basis, I'll wake up, open up my project, pull in any changes from my colleagues, and continue working locally until I'm ready to push my committed changes.
