# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Brody!

I hope you find this page helpful. In it, I've added a few resources and notes that you might find useful along the way. If you'd like to make it your own and add your own notes, you can fork the repository (i.e. make a copy onto your GitHub account), clone it (i.e. download your copy onto your laptop), and make changes as you see fit.

Good luck!
