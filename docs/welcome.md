## What is RHTAS?

[Trusted Artifact Signer](https://developers.redhat.com/products/trusted-artifact-signer/overview) (TAS) is Red Hat's enterprise-grade distribution of the popular open source project Sigstore.

If you're not already familiar with it, [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) is an open source project designed to improve the security of software supply chains. It provides an ecosystem of tools to sign, verify, and authenticate software  artifacts.

At Red Hat, we (currently) fall under the umbrella of Trusted Secure Supply Chain, or TSSC.

Sigstore is sold as a self-installed, on prem product only. Currently, it is only available on OpenShift, but we hope to have a RHEL install by EOY.
