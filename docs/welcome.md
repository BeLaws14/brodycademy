# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Brody!

I hope you find this page helpful. In it, I've added a few resources and notes that you might find useful along the way. If you'd like to make it your own and add your own notes, you can fork [the repository](https://github.com/kahboom/brodycademy) (i.e. make a copy onto your GitHub account), clone it (i.e. download your copy onto your laptop), and make changes as you see fit.

If you'd like to take a look at a suggested way to spend the day, please see the [Work Experience](./work-experience) section.

Good luck!

Rachel x
