# Common Commands

## git

Pull in changes from the remote repository (ie if your colleagues have made changes you need to pull into your local system):

```shell
git pull
```

Make changes locally in your IDE (e.g. VSCode, WebStorm), and commit the changes by first adding all the files to staging:

```shell
git add -A
```

And then committing them:

```shell
git commit -m "your commit message here"
```

Push changes when you're done:

```shell
git push
```

And, finally, you can open a pull request on GitHub for your colleagues to review.

If they are happy with it, they'll merge it.
