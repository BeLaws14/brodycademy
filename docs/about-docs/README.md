# ✏️️ Contributing

These docs are built with [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) and deployed to GitHub Pages.

To make changes to files, click the "Edit this Page" link at the bottom of any page. This will prompt you to create a pull request on GitHub with your proposed changes. Alternatively, you can edit the file directly from GitHub and create the pull request from there.

## Running Docs Locally

If you'd like to run the docs locally, you should clone the repo to your laptop.

### GitHub Repo

The repository for these docs is internal to `securesign` org members only and lives here: [securesign/team-docs](https://github.com/securesign/team-docs)

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
    - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

### Start the site

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.


### Docusaurus
