# Day 2: Web Dev (Frontend)

Web development, or web dev for short, refers to the tasks involved in designing, building, and maintaining of websites and web applications. This ranges anywhere from mobile (e.g. Android, iOS) to desktop apps.

# Frontend Development


# Project

Today you'll be working on your first frontend project. By the end of it, you will have learned how to build your first website, how to build your first web app, and what the difference is between the two.


## Website

All you need to make a website is an HTML file.

In your IDE, create a new empty project without any template, and create an `index.html` file in the root of it. It should look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

```

My suggestion is that you become familiar with HTML syntax, and then see how you can style the page and use tags to create your website.

Here is a really fun tutorial on how to create a 90s-style Under Construction page by one of my favorite digital artists, Jackie Liu:  [Build an Under Construction Page](https://www.zinesbyjackie.com/activities/build-an-under-construction-page)



## Web App

Time-permitting, next up we'll build a web application. To save time, usually developers use **libraries**, or sometimes **frameworks** (more opinionated on things like project structure, etc), which takes care of a lot of the repetitive tasks they have to do on each project setup.

These are a few of the most popular frontend libraries out there at the moment:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - React
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org) - No framework

Because React is the one I have to use at work (lucky you, it's the most popular frontend library in the world right now!), that's the one we'll be using.

Here's how you do it:

1. In your terminal, navigate to your projects directory
2. From the projects directory, run the following:

```shell

```

:::info[Hint]
Nowadays, the difference between a website and a web application can be blurry, but traditionally, a websites are static with information that doesn't change often. Web applications, or web apps, are _dynamic_ and interactive, accepting or storing input from users to be used dynamically at a future point (i.e. login). In other words, they are richer with more features.

## Bonus Bonus

React recommends working with one of the frameworks powered by it, the most common being Next.js. Using this kind of framework is possible because of the Node.js runtime. So, in sum:

- JavaScript is not a server-side language, it's a scripting language that does not get compiled
- 

We'll create a very tiny Next.js app that doesn't do much, but the point is to learn about how you can use the Node.js runtime to build a full-stack application using _only_ JavaScript. This wasn't even possible to do before 2011!

On top of that, we'll be using a React framework called Next.js, and that will contain a backend for us. In other words, you will be building a full-stack application.
